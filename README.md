## Applegoods
This project is to make a website to buy/sell apple goods. 

## Motivation
I was trying to make a new website for getting an entry level job. I'm a big fan of apple products and I often buy apple 'used' products since it's cheaper. Of course, there are already plenty of websites for selling/buying used goods but I wanted to make a website for apple goods only.
